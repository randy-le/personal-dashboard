Provide a brief explanation of your design decisions and the structure of your application.
- My initial thought was to display all three of the components on a single page, but then I saw the point of using a routing library. So then I decided against that and go with a panel that displayed data in a simple, straightforward fashion. When I think of a dashboard, I think more of like a car dashboard with a lot of information, but based on these components, I decided to think of it more as like a dashboard widget and simplified the view.
- The structure of the application is fairly straightforward. Router wraps the App, which renders the Dashboard which is the the view that renders our components/sub-views. In Dashboard, we have our routes based on the current route we are on and below are the links to navigate between components.
- Most of the visual components are raw HTML/CSS with the exception of the delete button on the todos. As well, I used only a couple of imported lodash functions to simplify things a bit.
